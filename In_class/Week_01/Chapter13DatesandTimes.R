# Another way to designate an amount of seconds
dseconds(32)

# R can use seconds conversions to add, subtract,multiply,
# and divide time units.

# Lets add 3 weeks to 5 days by converting to seconds

dweeks(3) + ddays(5)

# Lets subtract 72 seconds from 2 minutes
dminutes(2) - dseconds(72)

# Durations designations have limitations regarding some
# calculations that involve daylight savings time and 
# different time zone considerations.  It is better to 
# use Periods

# Intervals (Should be used because not all time units
# have the same number of subtime units)
    
# Example
    
# It should be clear that dyears(1)/ddays(365) is 
# approximately 1
    dyears(1)/ddays(365)

# Now consider the computation years(1)/days(1). Intuitively, 
# this answers the question "how many days are in a year.  
# 365
    years(1)/days(1)
    
# Some years have 365 days and some years have 366 days!! 

# In an ordinary year, if you were to count all the days 
# in a calendar from January to December, you'd 
# count 365 days. But approximately every four years, 
# February has 29 days instead of 28. So, there are 366 days
# in the year.

    
# Hence You should use Intervals !!
  (today() %--% next_year)/ddays(1)
  
# Now let's find the exact date, one year from now.
    next_year <- today() + years(1)
    next_year
    
    
    
# If you want to find out how many periods fall into an interval, 
# use %/%
    
    # How many days are there from today's date and 1 year
    # from now ?
    (today() %--% next_year)%/%days(1)
    
    # How many months are there from today's date and 1 year
    # from now ?
    
    (today() %--% next_year)/months(1)
